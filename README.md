# Carrot-Care

From students who are focusing on their education to employees who are pursuing their career, everyone has various priorities that they may neglect their personal needs.

Carrot Care is a self care app that encourages users to monitor how they are doing mentally and physically. With the app, they can track the number of cups of water they drink as well as how many hours they slept. They can also generate motivational quotes to help them throughout the day.

There is nothing special needed to know in order to run the code.
